1. There are two cvs files in this package, both are from Assignment 1:
   Dataset 1: lending_club_scaled.csv (originally from coursera, preprocessed in Assignment 1)
   Dataset 2: page-blocks.csv (download from http://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/category.php?cat=clas&order=ins#sub2)

2. There are five empty directories: Part1, Part2, Part3, Part4, Part5 are containers for the output csv files and graphs.

3. My code for each each part of the Assignment 3 are listed as follows.
   Part 1: clustering_p1.py
   Part 2 and Part 4: PCA_p2p4.py, ICA_p2p4.py, RP_p2p4.py and RF_p2p4.py
   Part 3 and Part 5: PCA_p3p5.py, ICA_p3p5.py, RP_p3p5.py and RF_p3p5.py
   A helper.py containing helper functions for all parts.

4. To run the code, on the terminal cd to this syan62 directory.
   In the syan62 directory, if under Linux environment type
   python clustering_p1.py
   python PCA_p2p4.py
   python ICA_p2p4.py
   python RP_p2p4.py
   python RF_p2p4.py
   python PCA_p3p5.py
   python ICA_p3p5.py
   python RP_p3p5.py
   python RF_p3p5.py
   If under Mac iOS environment, may need to type pythonw instead of python.

5. Python 2.7 is the environment that I run my python scripts. Python packages numpy, pandas, sklearn and matplotlib are imported in my code.
